# Style Guidelines

* Include spaces after commmas
* Don't go over the 79 per-line character limit
* Don't explicitly parameterize types unless it's necessary
* Never leave things without type qualifications. Use an explicit Any.
* Order method definitions from most specific to least specific type constraints
